This R script demonstrates the use of machine learning models, specifically Neural Networks and Random Forests, to classify banknote authenticity based on numerical features extracted from banknote images (*Image.Var*, *Image.Skew*, *Image.Curt*, and *Entropy*). The dataset `bank_note_data` is divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using `caTools`. A neural network is built using the `neuralnet` package, with one hidden layer containing 10 neurons and a non-linear activation function (`linear.output = FALSE`). The model predicts class probabilities on the test set, which are then rounded to generate binary classifications. The performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix. 

Additionally, a Random Forest classifier is trained using the same features and target variable (*Class*), with predictions evaluated similarly. The random forest model is used to compare performance, emphasizing its ensemble approach. This workflow demonstrates the application of neural networks for complex, non-linear patterns and random forests for robust, interpretable classification tasks in financial data analysis.
